= Do I have to install any software on my server or computer to get this working? =
Not at all! VictorChat is build on SAAS, (Software As A Service), which is a solution where all source code is hosted on our servers, 
so you only have to copy/paste a small piece of HTML code into your website, Blog or webshop for the Chat Window to be displayed. 
This solution makes VictorChat run faster, better and more secure on your sites. So simply configure the plugin and you're done!

We tested VictorChat in the following browsers, but know it will work in others as well: Internet Explorer 10 or later, Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari, Maxthon
