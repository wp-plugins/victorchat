Yes, you can use VictorChat on multiple websites, and you can even have 1 Agent control all the websites if needed.

= Do I have to install any software on my server or computer to get this working? =
Not at all! VictorChat is build on SAAS, (Software As A Service), which is a solution where all source code is hosted on our servers,
